            <li>Movies WebbShop breaks from the usual movie download site mould to offer a different kind of service than we are used to.</li>
            <li>It has also a huge collection of classic movies that will appeal to film buffs and enthusiasts.</li> 
            <li>Choose from thousands of titles and watch your favorite action, comedy, drama and horror movies streamed in Real Player or Windows Media Player formats.</li>
            <li>Watch hundreds of trailers and erotic movies right on your computer. The quality of the movies you watch from popcornFlix varies. Each movie usually has a broadband and narrowband option.</li>
            <li> On the plus side that means people with relatively slow connections can still enjoy streaming movies, but those with faster connections will be used to better quality.</li>
